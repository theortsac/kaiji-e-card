# Kaiji E-Card Game!
A game made in Python inspired in Kaiji E-Card game! I got the ideia from a movie I saw other day. You play using the slave cards, and the winning possibilites are:
- Slave vs Citizen = Defeat
- Slave vs King = Victory
- Citizen vs King = Defeat
- Citizen vs Citizen = Draw
Have fun!
